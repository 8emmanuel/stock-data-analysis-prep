Project Overview -
This project demonstrates the process of cleaning and preparing daily stock price and volume data for further analysis. The dataset contains historical prices for various stocks including Open, High, Low, Close prices, and trading volumes across multiple dates.

The cleaning steps include:

Inspecting and understanding the dataset
Handling missing values in price and volume data
Converting date columns to appropriate formats
Removing duplicate and erroneous records
Handling outliers such as negative prices or volumes
Feature engineering including calculation of daily returns
Saving a cleaned and well-structured dataset ready for analysis
This project showcases fundamental data cleaning skills using Python and pandas and is a strong example of real-world data preprocessing in the finance domain.
